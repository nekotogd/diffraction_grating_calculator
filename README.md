* Enter any 3 values that you know into the given spaces

* Hit calculate to find the last value

* Remember that anything written in standard form should be rewritten using "2.99e+08" format

* For example: 3 x 10^8 should be written as 3e+08 <h5>OR</h5> 2.5 x 10^-5 should be written as 2.5e-05



<h1>Additional notes:</h1>

* If you enter invalid values the program will clear all the text fields, indicating that some value does not mathematically work out

* You can also use the "Clear values" button to clear all the text fields and start over

* If you want you can also write values as normal decimals such as 0.00002546 instead of standard form
