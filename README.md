Enter any 3 values that you know into the given spaces

Hit calculate to find the last value

Remember that anything written in standard form should be rewritten using "2.99e+08" format

For example: 3 x 10^8 should be written as 3e+08

or 2.5 x 10^-5 should be written as 2.5e-05



If you enter invalid values the program will clear all the text fields, indicating that some value does not mathematically work out

You can also use the "Clear values" button to clear all the text fields and start over

If you want you can also write values as normal decimals such as 0.00002546 instead of standard form
